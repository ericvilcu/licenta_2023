# WHAT
I am not very sure what I am doing.

# To build:
make a build directory (typically `mkdir build`)
go to that build directory (typically `cd build`)
configure (typically `cmake ..`)
build (`cmake --build ..` or open in visual studio)

# Patience
Be patient, as it LITERALLY has about 2GB of libraries to load before it starts. (and 6 GB more for CUDNN...)
(mostly torchlib+cuda interop stuff)
